Write a program that takes two String input's i.e "str1" , "str2" and returns the letters of str2 that are not in the str1

Example : 
	Assume if two strings given by user are
		-> str1 = "hello"
		-> str2 = "world"

solution 

def find():
    str1=set(input("Enter the first string : ").casefold())
    str2=set(input("Enter the second string : ").casefold())
    letternot = str2.difference(str1)
    print("Letters of str2 that are not in the str1",set(letternot))
