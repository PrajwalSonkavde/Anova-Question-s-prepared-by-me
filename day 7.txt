Problem statement : A person wants to know the steps he has walk to reach destination and return back to the same place
note : 
	-> for every 1 meter person has to walk 1.3123 steps
	-> python program must take input i.e distance in kilometer only
example :
	If kilometer given is 1.5 kilometer then no of meters will 1500
	so 1500 meter * 1.3123 steps = 1968 steps he has to walk to reach destination and to return he has to walk again 1968 steps 
	total steps he has to walk = 1968 + 1968 = 3936

Solution :
		def check_distance():
		    return int(((float(input("Enter distance in kilometer : "))*1000)*1.3123)*2)
