1)write function that returns no of ways to award 1st, 2nd and 3rd cup among given input 'n' participants
	note : 
		-> get the input 'n' from user
		-> restrict the participants 'n' to 250
 example : assume if no of participates 'n' given are 9
	     no of ways to award 1st, 2nd and 3rd cup are 504
(Hint : use mathematics permutation ) 
if example n = 8 
	then possible ways : 8! * 7! * 6* =336 orelse use perumutation formula			
Ans 
def pp():
    n = int(input("Enter no of participants : "))
    if n > 250:
        print("Error can participate in event")
    else:
        temp=n
        for i in range(1,3):
            temp = (n-i)*temp
        return "No of ways to awards cup are {}".format(temp)
