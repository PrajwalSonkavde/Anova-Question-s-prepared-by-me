Problem statement : 
there is a fish in a tank ,Everytime it move’s forward the fish move’s by 1 meter and fish jumps out of water after every 5 meters it move’s forward and tank size will be provided by user
Note : the fish moves from one end to other end in a tank
	write a function 
-> that checks no of times fish jumped out of water in a tank 
-> minimum tank size must be 5 meters (throw a error if tank size is less than 5 meters)
-> tank size must be provided by user(take input from user)
	Example :
		Assume if tank size is 23 meters then fish jumps 4 times out of water
Ans 
def checkjumps():
    n = int(input("Enter the tank size : "))
    return n//5
checkjumps()
	Input : Enter the tank size : 200004
	Output : 40000
